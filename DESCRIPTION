Description: An easy-to-use tool for latent class analysis for recurrent events. The modeling framework is based on the semiparametric multiplicative modeling in Zhao et al. (2022) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12499>. Our package provides an alternative method to define initial values in the estimation algorithm based on a joint frailty scale-change model described in Wang et al. (2001) <doi:10.1198/016214501753209031> and K-means. Users are also allowed to specify different initial values by themselves. Our package also provides an alternative algorithm to solving the estimating equation for unobservable latent class membership by fitting a "pseudo" weighted multinomial regression which speeds up the rate of convergence.
